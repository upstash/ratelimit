# Upstash Redis

An HTTP/REST based Redis client built on top of Upstash REST API.
[Upstash REST API](https://docs.upstash.com/features/restapi).

[![Tests](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)
![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@upstash/ratelimit)
![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/@upstash/ratelimit)

It is the only connectionless (HTTP based) ratelimiter and designed for:

- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda ...)
- Cloudflare Workers
- Fastly Compute@Edge (see
- Next.js, Jamstack ...
- Client side web/mobile applications
- WebAssembly
- and other environments where HTTP is preferred over TCP.

## Quick Start

### Install

#### npm

```bash
npm install @upstash/ratelimit
```

#### Deno

```ts
import { Redis } from "https://deno.land/x/upstash_ratelimit/mod.ts";
```

### Create database

Create a new redis database on [upstash](https://console.upstash.com/)

### Use it

See [here](https://github.com/upstash/upstash-redis#quick-start) for
documentation on how to create a redis instance.

```ts
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit"; // for deno: see above
import { Redis } from "@upstash/redis";

// Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow("10 s", 10),
});

function limited() {
  // Use a constant string to limit all requests with a single ratelimit
  // Or use a userID, apiKey or ip address for individual limits.
  const identifier = "api";
  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(identifier);

  if (!success) {
    return "Unable to process at this time";
  }
  doExpensiveCalculation();
  return "Here you go!";
}
```

The `limit` method returns some more metadata that might be useful to you:

```ts
export type RatelimitResponse = {
  /**
   * Whether the request may pass(true) or exceeded the limit(false)
   */
  success: boolean;

  /**
   * Maximum number of requests allowed within a window.
   */
  limit: number;

  /**
   * How many requests the user has left within the current window.
   */
  remaining: number;

  /**
   * Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the limits are reset.
   */
  reset: number;
};
```

## Ratelimiting algorithms

We provide different algorithms to use out of the box. Each has pros and cons.

### Fixed Window

This algorithm divides time into fixed durations/windows. For example each
window is 10 seconds long. When a new request comes in, the current time is used
to determine the window and a counter is increased. If the counter is larger
than the set limit, the request is rejected.

#### Pros:

- Very cheap in terms of data size and computation
- Newer requests are not starved due to a high burst in the past

#### Cons:

- Can cause high bursts at the window boundaries to leak through
- Causes request stampedes if many users are trying to access your server,
  whenever a new window begins

#### Usage:

Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds.

```ts
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow("10 s", 10),
});
```

### Sliding Window

Builds on top of fixed window but instead of a fixed window, we use a rolling
window. Take this example: We have a rate limit of 10 requests per 1 minute. We
dividie time into 1 minute slices, just like in the fixed window algorithm.
Window 1 will be from 00:00:00 to 00:01:00 (HH:MM:SS). Let's assume it is currently
00:01:15 and we have received 4 requests in the first window and 5 requests so
far in the current window. The approximation to determine if the request should
pass works like this:

```ts
limit = 10

// 4 request from the old window, weighted + requests in current window
rate = 4 * ((60 - 15) / 60) + 5 = 8

return rate < limit // True means we should allow the request
```

#### Pros:

- Solves the issue near boundary from fixed window.

#### Cons:

- More expensive in terms of storage and computation
- Is only an approximation, because it assumes a uniform request flow in the
  previous window, but this is fine in most cases

#### Usage:

Create a new ratelimiter, that allows 10 requests per 10 seconds.

```ts
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow("10 s", 10),
});
```

### Token Bucket

Consider a bucket filled with `{maxTokens}` tokens that refills constantly at
`{refillRate}` per `{interval}`. Every request will remove one token from the
bucket and if there is no token to take, the request is rejected.

#### Pros:

- Bursts of requests are smoothed out and you can process them at a constant
  rate.
- Allows to set a higher initial burst limit by setting `maxTokens` higher than
  `refillRate`

#### Cons:

- Expensive in terms of computation

#### Usage:

Create a new bucket, that refills 5 tokens every 10 seconds and has a maximum size of 10.

```ts
const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.tokenBucket("10 s", 5, 10),
});
```

### [Install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation)

### Database

Create a new redis database on [upstash](https://console.upstash.com/) and copy
the url and token.
